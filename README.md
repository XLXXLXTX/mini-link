## Description:
Simple URL shortener app that takes a long URL and returns a shortened version of it, which can be used to redirect to the original URL.

## Functionalities:

- **Redirect:** When accessing a shortened URL, the app redirects to the original URL.
- **QR Code:** The app generates a QR code for the shortened URL that can be scanned/saved.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** The app supports light/dark mode.
- **Responsive Design:** The app is responsive and works on mobile devices.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** The user can copy the shortened URL to the clipboard.
- **Error Handling:** the app handles errors and displays them to the user.


## Technology Stack:
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: SQLite with TursoDB
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## How to run:
This project uses two different `.env` files, one for the frontend and another for the backend. Both files must be created in the respective directories, and can be based on the `.env.template` files provided.

### Database in local environment:
If you run the backend project locally, an SQLite database file will be created in the root of the project with the name `mini-link-local.db`. This can be changed editing the `LOCAL_DB_PATH` variable in the backend `.env` file.

### Modifying default ports:

- <u>Backend:</u> ***the backend server runs by default in the port `3000`***, you can modify it by changing the value of the `PORT` variable in the backend `.env` file. **Remember to also change the value of the `VITE_BACKEND_URL` variable in the frontend `.env` file to match the url and port where the backend project is running.**
- <u>Frontend:</u> ***the frontend server runs by default in the port `5173`***, you can modify it by changing the value in the `vite.config.js` file in the `client` directory.

### Run in local environment:
After configuring the project, you can run it by following these steps:

1. Install dependencies for both the frontend and backend projects from the root directory of the project:
```bash
npm run install:all
```

2. Run the backend project:
```bash
npm run start:backend
```

3. Run the frontend project:
```bash
npm run start:frontend
```

4. Access the frontend project at `http://localhost:5173` by default.
